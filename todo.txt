XX	capture area (Not adding)
~~  add 4 inputs to change capture size to capture specific area
~~  add open captures folder
~~  a effect for when the capture is saved
~~  exiting to space center then entering back dosent make the menu
~~  fix: when the menu is closed hiding the ui causing the preview to show when menu is still closed
~~  add border to preview
~~  camera gets rotated
~~  add show interirors button
    add auto updater
    dynamic camera quality is wrong it should be high quality when not moving
    make show interirors affect the preview only
