	capture area

    add 4 inputs to change capture size to capture specific area

~~  add open captures folder

~~  a effect for when the capture is saved

~~  exiting to space center then entering back dosent make the menu

    add auto updater

    fix: when the menu is closed hiding the ui causing the preview to show when menu is still closed

    add border to preview

    changing background color then showing background still keeps the selected color
    cant make background transparent when in space becuse it uses the custom background color
        becuse it dosent have a atomsphere to mask the background is camera solid color

    camera gets rotated
